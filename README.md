# Firechat
- Simple chat application with Firebase as backend.
- Used Firebase logo as color scheme to theme the application.
- User can see all conversations created with the applications. Users can interact with all the available contacts
- User can edit status, can chose profile picture. 
- Lots of stuff. 

I have used a datamodel that will effectively avoid redundacy of chat database. 
- Created 2 head nodes
    - Conversations
    - Users
- Users node contains personal information of the user. Every user has a sub-node "Messages" which contains a key to all of his active conversation nodes



- Below is snapshot of datamodel.
